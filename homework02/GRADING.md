Homework 02 - Grading
=====================

**Score**: 14.75 / 15

Deductions
----------
Activity 1
-0.25 question 3, we are creating new files and making a copy instead of using hard links


Comments
--------
Activity 1, question 2: reasoning is valid but also not that because the hard links just store references to existing inotes and don't copy the contents of the file, 11 MB or 10MB is not surprising
